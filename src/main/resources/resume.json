    "text": "A software engineer working on Enterprise projects since I was 19 (for 12 years). With a high IQ of 126, I have been a fast learner and creative problem solver (I created a simple app which will generate a customized version of this resume on https://github.com/amirmv2006/amv-resume-generator). I have always finished the learning period of the companies in less than half the expected time. I get motivated by how unsolvable a problem is! The harder a problem is, the more joy it will bring when solved. I also believe one can always learn from ANYONE and love technical discussions."
