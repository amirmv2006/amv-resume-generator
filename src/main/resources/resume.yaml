- title: Summary
  text: A technical architect working on Enterprise Java Projects since I was 19 (for 13 years). Fast learner,
    creative problem solver and enthusiastic computer admirer! I have an eye for details in computer and
    when I see an interesting software “feature”, I usually challenge myself by thinking about how I could
    deliver such feature. Self-motivated and good at reading other developers’ code. I enjoy technical
    discussions, knowledge sharing and also believe that one can always learn from ANYONE.

            account in each one of them. When someone wants to transfer money to another
            chain, they will just choose the target chain and account, and then a transfer
            will be made to the switcher account in their own chain (completely transparent
            to final user) the rest will be handled by Switcher app, meaning it will automatically
            make the required transfers to the intermediary switchers’ accounts so that
            the money is delivered to the destination account.
